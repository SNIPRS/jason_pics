Jason Liu's birthday is coming up on July 4th this year (and every year!)! Let's compile the best ugly photos of Jason for this big man's big 20th birthday!!
 - An Open Sourced Project by Tao, Steven, and YOU

## Instructions
PLEASE put your photo in a **separate branch** labelled with **YOUR NAME** if you are uploading over 200MB of resources! We don't wanna crash git clone xD

use `git checkout -b "BRANCH NAME"` to create branch  
use `git checkout "BRANCH NAME"` to go to an existing branch
use `git fetch` and `git pull` to get the latest changes

### Other git commands that you may need
use `git add .` to add all files within your directory
use `git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"` to stage your commit
use `git push` to push your commit. Github will require you to set-upstream-origin for you branch when you push for the first time, please follow the command lines in the terminal as required

##### If you are unfamiliar with Github, please contact, Me (Steven) and Tao, and we would be glad to help
